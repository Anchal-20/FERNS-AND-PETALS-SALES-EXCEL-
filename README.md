📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales performance and regional trends of Ferns & Petals using Excel. The goal is to uncover actionable insights from raw sales data to support better decision-making in inventory, promotions, and regional targeting.

🎯 Business Problem

Ferns & Petals, a gifting and floral company, generates large amounts of sales data across products and regions. However, raw data alone cannot answer key questions like:

Which regions drive the highest sales?

What are the peak demand periods?

Which product categories contribute most to revenue?

How can sales insights support better inventory and promotion planning?

This project addresses these by cleaning, transforming, and visualizing sales data in Excel.
